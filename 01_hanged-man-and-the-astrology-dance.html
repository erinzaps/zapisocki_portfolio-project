      </h2>
      <p>
        In October 2020, I went on a solo trip to
        Tofino, a seaside town on the coastline of
        Vancouver Island. I have often sought out time
        alone, a necessity especially with a roommate
        as I had at the time. My infatuation with
        manifestation and universal co-creation
        occurred earlier that year after learning of
        and completing a few To Be Magnetic workshops.
        This movement did not follow any particular
        moment or instance; I typically accelerate into
        lively spurts of self-development after many
        low roars of self-development. Everything of my
        own volition, hungry always to find out more,
        time after time running into the fire to be
        gladly burned.
      </p>

      <p>
        I bid my roommate and her cat farewell and left
        the cozy Marpole apartment. The Horseshoe Bay
        ferry took me to Nanaimo, then a three hour
        drive through Parksville and Port Alberni,
        eventually coming to a fork where one can go
        south to Ucluelet, north to Tofino, or still
        west directly into the Pacific Ocean. My
        incompetence with curating playlists led me to
        a prefabricated edition by one Jaime Tobias, a
        stranger somewhere out there in the world who
        didn’t seem much like a stranger with the
        similarities between our musical interests. I
        exhausted my lungs to Maggie Rogers’ “Falling
        Water” about eight times in a row before having
        steady-enough service to advance the song. It’s
        a great way to clear out the throat chakra.
        Semi-related: I always think that if you want
        to have a good, cathartic cry, have a yell
        first to bring those emotions to the surface
        (if you dare).
      </p>

      <p>
        My life is characterized by a challenge to
        feel. Being a Cancer Sun, it seems my duty is
        to be moved by matters, people, and the world
        in general (more on that to come). I must
        remark, though, on my conscious avoidance of
        emotions. I have upended various rooms of my
        life in an effort to find out what I’m doing
        here. I might liken it to furiously trying to
        find your glasses, looking high and low,
        stomping around in frustration only to find
        them on your head. At the end of the day, I
        feel like I know what my purpose is and,
        fittingly, tears well as I write this. Out of
        gratitude, sadness, or knowing, I am not sure.
        I think perhaps the first. Maybe tears of
        mercy… tears you cry when you come home after
        being away for a very long time.
      </p>

      <h3>Hello from Tofino</h3>

      <p>
        I stayed at Hotel Zed, a newly completed build
        a few minutes’ walk from Chesterman Beach. It
        was golden hour when I arrived. I had an
        obligatory taco from the original Tacofino food
        truck and walked to the beach to catch the
        sunset. I had created a schedule for myself
        that included touristy things like whale
        watching and surf lessons, but I also brought
        my yoga mat and had every intention to go
        within and to contemplate deeply. I never
        experienced life in the seventies, but I
        appreciated a manufactured, packaged version of
        this decade in the form of brass sunburst
        hardware, loud, patterned carpet, and accents
        in various shades of brown, orange, and purple.
        I loved the novelty of the establishment, right
        down to their disco (complete with disco ball),
        their sunken lounge wrapped in thick green
        carpet, and their more intimate “Psychic’s
        Den”, where I was to meet Karedwyn Bird, a
        local artist and astrologer, among other
        admirable titles. She was to interpret my natal
        chart for me, another piece of my perpetual
        scramble to uncover my purpose. The night
        before our meeting I received a confirmation
        call. The connection was scratchy and she
        apologized for the poor reception, explaining
        she was calling from a houseboat. She asked if
        I had my birth date, time, and place and I said
        yes to all. This wasn’t my first rodeo. They
        seem to be the three keys to the art of
        astrology and me being me, I kept them all
        close at hand, desperately ready to shell them
        out as soon as I recognized an opportunity to
        find out more about myself.
      </p>

      <h3>The reading</h3>
      <p>
        We agreed to meet at 7 o’clock in the
        aforementioned Psychic’s Den. Being both an
        interior designer and appreciator of all things
        esoteric (you may relate better to the term
        woo-woo), I loved this room. Heavy velvet
        curtains separated it from the hotel lobby,
        doing an adequate job of blocking out light and
        sound from the other side. The room was small
        and rectangular with a curved banquette seat
        running along the back wall. It was offset,
        allowing spiritual tchotchkes to sit on a
        ledge. A low, gold table with a crystal ball
        sat on top of a collection of plush rugs. A
        small chandelier hung low from the ceiling,
        topping the entire setting and sending a radius
        of light and dark spots on the wall and ground.
        Karedwyn was there when I elevatored down from
        my room. She was tall and bony. Her eyes were
        wide, emphasized with glasses that she pivoted
        up and down frequently from the top of her head
        to the bridge of her nose. When they were on
        her head it pushed up pieces of her hair in
        loops. Even if she knew this I don’t think she
        would have cared; despite her willowy frame,
        her jewelry, and thin cardigan, she had a
        careless, masculine presence, sitting with her
        knees apart and taking up space like a box. She
        was wonderfully unpredictable. Karedwyn
        introduced me to something called Kabalistic
        Tarot Numerology. I haven’t read much about it
        since, but to my understanding she added the
        numbers of each the month, day, and year of my
        birth and broke the sum down into smaller
        numbers with the first of those being a sort of
        predominant integer. This integer would
        correspond to a major arcana card in a deck of
        tarot. My reading would consist of this
        number/tarot combo as well as an interpretation
        of my natal chart.
      </p>

      <h3>The magic number</h3>
      <p>
        The number 12 had never held so much weight,
        and I felt like I depended on it as if it might
        unlock potential as quickly as snapping one’s
        fingers. It didn’t, really, but it did plant a
        seed. Maybe that seed had been there my whole
        life, the entirety of my twenty-five years, and
        I was only just noticing it, feeling it inside
        me like an almond in its pocked shell or a
        pearl in a clam. You see, the number 12
        corresponds to the Hanged Man. The Hanged Man
        is a beautiful card if not for its symbolism
        then for its depiction in my own Fountain Tarot
        deck. A man hangs upside-down by his right
        ankle, left knee bent, foot behind the right
        knee, creating the number 4 with the lower
        body. He hangs with his shoulders proudly
        square, arms linked behind his back. In
        traditional decks he is depicted with a halo,
        but in my deck the sun sets behind him,
        directly under his head. To me this ball of sun
        is his halo. Its a key aspect of this card; the
        yellow glow is a sign of intellect. Little Red
        Tarot said it best: “[The Hanged Man doesn’t]
        mind hanging upside down. It’s a choice. Doing
        nothing can be so much harder than doing
        something, but the Hanged Man has the courage,
        discipline, and self-respect to do it.” If you
        were upside-down you might be caught in
        struggle, like a rabbit in a snare trap, but
        there’s peace here in this card. I knew it then
        and a year of reflection has me noticing even
        more of it.

      <p>
        Doing nothing is one of the most difficult
        things to do. To touch the water is to muddy it
        is to not see clearly; to let the water be by
        not touching it is to see clearly. In my mind’s
        eye I see the devil’s snare from Harry Potter,
        Hermione gracefully slipping through and down
        by remaining calm. That is the way I want to
        approach life, but I tend to pull Ron-Weasleys,
        not being able to stop squirming and flailing
        long enough to relax the vines around my wrists
        and ankles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Karedwyn told me of the Hanged Man and the path
        of surrender and glory it teaches. I sat with
        eyes like orbs, legs politely crossed. I
        dressed in all black, something she commented
        on when we reached the topic of
        self-expression. She told me I ought to take up
        more space, to figuratively smack down my
        presence and my reason for being anywhere like
        it was a sack of gold coins, saying something
        like “Yes! I am alone here”, in a way that
        might also tell you I wouldn’t have it any
        other way. I have oft walked this path of
        self-discovery timidly, shy about my age in
        relation to spiritual development.
        Chronologically I was twenty-five, but
        spiritually I felt eighty.
      </p>

      <p>
        I don’t think you need to be old to be
        spiritual. I don’t think you need to endure
        years of life lessons, of hardship, to grasp
        the person you are becoming. In Abraham Hicks’
        fashion, were I to abolish the words “I don’t”
        from my vocabulary, I would say that you can be
        young and spiritual at the same time; that you
        can be spiritual at any age. You were the
        person you are becoming when you were born; in
        other words, becoming yourself and developing
        yourself as a human being is the exact same
        thing as coming home to yourself. You were born
        knowing. You knew it then and you know it now.
        Your worth was full in your conscious and your
        subconscious and you did not doubt or question
        it. You slept when you were tired and ate when
        you were hungry. You played and asked questions
        and pushed the envelope. I think coming home to
        yourself is a lot like that. What makes it
        sometimes feel foreign, wrong, is the world
        around us insistent on becoming something or
        someone. I am reminded of this quote:
      </p>
      <h4>
        The meaning of life is just to be alive. It is
        so plain and so obvious and so simple. And yet,
        everybody rushes around in a great panic as if
        it were necessary to achieve something beyond
        themselves” - Alan Watts
      </h4>
      <p>
        I do not wish to lend too much attention to the
        following, but for contrast I would ask the
        purpose of greed, of corporate superstructures,
        of clear-cutting, literally, the world around
        us with such venom. These things are so;
        however much I wish they weren’t, they are
        within my scope upside down like the Hanged Man
        and I am grateful even for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        He sees things from a different perspective,
        courageously making the choice to watch the
        happenings of the world around him unfold,
        maybe waiting for the right time to take
        action. There is an exorbitant amount of beauty
        here, upside down. More and more I settle into
        the idea that is is a gift to feel so deeply.
        It presents challenges, definitely, but it is
        not a sad thing to be so aware of the world
        around you.
      </p>
      <h3>The birth chart</h3>
      <p>
        I would like to write about the natal chart
        portion of my reading, so that (a) I can
        solidify the memory, and (b) to quench the
        curiosity of those who have read thus far. I
        find astrology intriguing. There is a basis of
        it so wondrous I’m not sure a word exists for
        it. You do not have to fulfill the naysayer
        archetype, wary of women with crystals whose
        knees knock with the words What time were you
        born, to know and believe that life is a dance
        between happenstance and free will. I like to
        think that dance is the basis of everyone’s
        existence. To believe in astrology is not to
        lean on it totally, to depend on it, or to
        expect it to make your decisions for you. It’s
        a tool and a skeleton. The rest is meat and
        muscle, determined by you without you even
        trying to do so. By only being here you are
        writing your story.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite possessing a matronly Cancer Sun, I
        have four planets in Gemini, with Gemini being
        also my rising/ascendant sign. One interesting
        piece imparted on me was that through all your
        lives, your rising sign remains the same.
        Through hundreds of lives, I did have and will
        expect Gemini to be rising into the eastern sky
        at the time of my birth. While Cancer is homey
        and protective, Gemini is playful and curious.
        Russell Brand is the most embodied Gemini I
        know, being exactly in the middle of the Gemini
        “window”, equidistant from the Taurus-Gemini
        cusp and the Gemini-Cancer cusp. I was born
        closer to the Gemini-Cancer cusp, which means I
        may embody more Gemini qualities despite being
        a Cancer Sun in actuality. This makes sense to
        me, though I have often held onto a Cancer
        identity without giving the other, explorative
        part of me room to breathe. I feel as though
        this version of myself is seen and yearned for
        by me, but it is just beyond reach. This wonder
        is a path home to myself, I think.
      </p>
      <p>
        The qualities of my chart are predominantly
        mutable air signs. Translation: I will try my
        best at all times to harmonize with the world
        around me, often before recognizing my own
        needs. I like to think this is why I have my
        fingers in so many pies. I used to feel ashamed
        of this, but I now pray that my feet never
        touch the ground. How exciting it is to lead a
        varied life, to be able to do so many things.
        It does mean a lot of unfinished projects and
        distractions, but for me, forget being
        committed unless it be to change.
      </p>
      <h3>Cancers are crabs</h3>
      <p>
        When a crab molts it separates its tissues and
        muscles from its shell. It takes in water and
        swells, becoming so full that it cracks,
        forming a seam near the back of its body. Using
        its legs, it pushes itself backwards out of its
        own skeleton. It is vulnerable now with its
        new, soft shell. Until it hardens, the crab
        will hide from predators, continuing to take in
        water so that the shell hardens with some room
        to grow. I sat fascinated as Karedwyn told me
        of the process, totally cognizant of the fact
        that in the fall/winter season of each year I
        complete a similar process of ridding myself of
        heavy burdens and (proverbial) parasites. It
        has manifested as a new job, a big move, and
        the end of a relationship (sometimes all three,
        god help me). There have been times, are times,
        when I feel like my shell is too hard to crack
        no matter how much water I take in, or that I
        am too weak to squeeze out of it. There are
        times when I feel like my shell will never
        harden and that it will remain soft and prone
        to injury. Molting involves calculated risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have recounted my experience with Karedwyn
        several times with different people. Sometimes
        I feel that these memories of mine are too
        precious to put out into the world. My instinct
        is to hold them close to the vest, away from
        prying eyes and from people who sometimes seem
        committed to misunderstanding a sensitive
        individual. I’m not sure this method is serving
        me anymore though. This season, I feel more
        inclined to share.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to circle back to the Hanged Man briefly
        and layer it onto my chart reading so as to
        make better sense of all the information. I
        have a hunch. I am here at my kitchen table,
        blanket on my lap and jasmine tea inches from
        my right hand. My eyes are heavy. I am tired
        but not sleepy. To become unsleepy one needs
        sleep; to become untired, one must find value
        and meaning in their decisions and actions. I’d
        rather not declare to the world again and
        again, I think I’ve got it this time, but I
        will say I feel more full by writing. I am
        upside down by choice. It is so quiet here that
        my ears ring, but I can’t see myself anywhere
        else. I gather the courage to open my eyes and
        find beauty here where most may not see it, and
        I’m sharing it with you. If you’ve made it so
        far as to read this article in its entirety,
        thank you.
